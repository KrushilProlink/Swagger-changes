                A budget is an estimation of revenue and expenses over a
                specified future period of time and is utilized by governments,
                businesses, and individuals.

                A budget is basically a financial plan for a defined period,
                normally a year that is known to greatly enhance the success of
                any financial undertaking. (Investopedia)
